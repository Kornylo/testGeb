# Resource bundle for all strings, messages, and other resources the this module uses.
# Keys and entries below duplicated from application.properties.
#
# When changing resource bundle keys, make sure you CHANGE application.properties FIRST,
# and only then modify the locale specific version.
#
# Conventions:
# 1. Add comments (using #) before parameterized strings, explaining the parameters
#    (including {0} and @comm style params)
# 2. Try to give the strings names that would make sense from a UI perspective, not Java
#    perspective
# 3. Copy this header to each locale
# 4. Strings in default file (application.properties) should match en_US version,
#    prefixed with ???

ip.2fa.user.config.disclaimer-content=To protect patient data privacy, Medtronic has implemented a two-step verification process to allow a more secure login to your CareLink account.  A two-step verification process involves logging into CareLink with your username and password, and as a second step, entering a security passcode (sent to your mobile phone or email address).  If you choose, you can turn off this two-step verification process, provided this is in compliance with your country or local laws.  Please note, however, you may be liable in case of a data breach or similar incident involving your patient data, under the privacy laws, regulations, and penalties of your country/jurisdiction.  Medtronic therefore strongly recommends that you talk with your data privacy officer, legal counsel, or equivalent, before turning this two-step verification "Off".
